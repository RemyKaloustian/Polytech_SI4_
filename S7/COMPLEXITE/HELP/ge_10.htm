<DD>After you have selected some objects, you may delete them by selecting
the <B>Edit</B>/<B>Delete </B>menu option or the button on the toolbar.
Notice that all the edit operations - delete, cut/copy/paste - are available
in the context menu of the current machine, that you can get with a right-click
on the background. When you delete some instructions, all the arrows that
link them are deleted.</DD>
