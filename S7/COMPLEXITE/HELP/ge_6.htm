<DD>A very useful feature of the editor is the branch tool. By selecting
<B>Tools</B>/<B>Insert branch</B> or the button on the toolbar, you can
extend the graph-program by adding a branch. What is a branch? It is simply
an arrow that links the selected instruction to another. The inserting
of the arrow and the new instruction is made in just a step. Choose the
&quot;destination&quot; instruction and fly over the &quot;source&quot;
instruction. The shape of the cursor suggests the direction of the branch
- if any - like in the figure below. When you click, the branch appears.
