<DD>When you start Visual Turing environment, a default project is created
by default. You can also create a new project using the <B>File</B>/<B>New</B>
menu option or pressing the <B>New</B> button on the main toolbar. This
project contains a single machine named &quot;Main&quot;- you can change
the name later, using the properties dialog of this procedure and the symbol
which is common to all Turing machines: <B># </B>the blank symbol. Note
that you cannot delete this symbol during the development time, neither
the main machine inserted by default, so you must place your graph there.</DD>
